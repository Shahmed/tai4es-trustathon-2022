    "### Goal: Train and evaluate regression ML models on the sub-SEVIR dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we train and evaluate regression machine learning (ML) models on the sub-SEVIR dataset. sub-SEVIR is a lower-resolution version of the Storm Event Imagery Dataset. The new spatial resolution is 8 km with a 60 min timestep resolution for each event. Our goal is to train a regression model to predict the number of lightning flashes. \n",

    "For simplicity, we limited our model selection to linear regression, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees. For each model, the default hyperparameters were used. "

    "When training ML models, we often have to pre-processing the data. For this example, we want to scaling the data so that each feature has a mean of zero and variance of 1. Scikit-learn has a great feature known as [Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) where the pre-processing is incorporated into the model. Thus, when you call `.predict` or `.predict_proba`, the pre-processing is applied internally. \n"
